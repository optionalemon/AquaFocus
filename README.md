## Description

### Aim
Our project is developed with the aim of motivating the students to manage their tasks, while also facilitating the management process. 

### Features

1. **Focus Timer** -> Performing both countup and countdown, helps users to stay focused! ~~Definitely not inspired by a tree-planting app~~
2. **To-do List** -> Helps users to organise their one-time daily tasks
3. **Habit Tracker** -> Helps users to manage their daily, weekly or monthly goals for habits
4. **A Beatiful Magnificent S-_blue_-endid _Fin_-tastic Aquarium** -> Gamified aspect of the app. Users can buy sea creatures from all over the world and put into their own aquarium!
